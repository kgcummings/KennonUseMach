<h3>2006 - 2009</h3>
Found on the now-defunct website of a Brooklyn-based Italian bakery. This was an image of the bakery's owner-- an older portly gentleman with balding grey hair holding a dish of tiramisu. He's smiling wide, using his free 
hand to point at something out of frame. This image left us when the bakery this was made for closed down following a death in the 
owner's family. We mourn the bakery. We mourn this image.
